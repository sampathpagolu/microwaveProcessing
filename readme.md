I am using my home microwave oven for this project.

#### Buttons

__Common usage__: Buttons are the most used feature on a Microwave.

My microwave has 25 buttons in total. Each and every button when pressed plays a beep as sound feedback to the user. More options equals more complexity. Keeping that aside, the major flaw in my Microwave's design is Buttons are very hard to press.

My microwave always displays the wrong time, I could change it to show correct the time and I have tried, gave up halfway because my finger started to hurt.

__Solution__: Replace the buttons with something more tactile. Buttons which are clickable are more comfortable, they also provide a haptic feedback that can be super helpful.

  <p> I am using my home microwave oven for this project.</p>

    <h3>Buttons</h3>
    <img src="./project-photos/buttons.gif" width="300">


    <p><b>Common usage</b>: Buttons are the most used feature on a Microwave.

      My microwave has 25 buttons in total. Each and every button when pressed
      plays a beep as sound <i>feedback</i> to the user. More options equals more
      complexity. Keeping that aside, the major flaw in my Microwave's design
      is Buttons are very hard to press.

      My microwave always displays the wrong time, I could change it to show
      correct the time and I have tried, gave up halfway because my finger
       started to hurt.
    </p>
    <p><b>Common sequence</b>: I am hungry and I want to cook some rice for
      myself. I have to cook the rice in Microwave oven for approximately 20 minutes.
      This time varies according to the quantity of rice I am cooking. For suppose
      one day I am cooking extra rice, I have to put in more time. If I make a
      mistake in entering the time I have to start again. If I put less time,
      I can add more time by clicking on "add 30 sec" button. What if I want to
      add 5 minutes, I have to click 10 times to add 5 minutes.</p>

    <p><b>Solution</b>:</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Replace the buttons with something more tactile. Buttons which are
        clickable are more comfortable, they also provide a haptic <i>feedback</i>
        that can be super helpful.</li>
      <li>Remove the buttons entirely for setting and time introduce a dial for
        easy setting of the time.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Display</h3>

    <p>
      My Microwave has a tiny display, that is good enough to set the time,
      see the remaining time or check the time of the day.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Common sequence/Common mistake</b>: I am very stressed due to a project submission
      and I want to drink some tea. I go to the kitchen to heat the water for my
      tea I pour water into cup and put it in the Microwave oven and start cooking
      by pressing down onone of the express cook options. It beeps twice, giving
      me <i>feedback</i> that timer is already set for something else.
    </p>

    <img src="./project-photos/display.jpg" width="200">
    <img src="./project-photos/display.gif" width="350">

    <p>
      First image is when timer is set. Second Image is Time of the day.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I check the display, I see in very tiny letters saying cook. Now I
      have to click start/stop button or reset it and give a new time. This
      seemingly small clicks to heat my water is very annoying. Even though
      there is some indication that time of the day is being displayed like ':'
      is blinking which is hardly noticeable at a single glance.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Solution</b>: Add different colored LEDs to give the user <i>feedback</i>
      on what is being displayed at the moment. A red LED can be used to display
      the timer like in the image below. Now a days LEDs can show multiple colors
      according to the voltage fed to them. If those LEDs are used, different
       colors can be displayed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, a new feature can be added to the microwave. If cooking
      stops in the middle, the timer should reset after a certain period of time.
      There is no use in preserving the remaining cooking time hours after the
      timer is stopped in the middle.

  <div id="stop_clear" , class="problem">
    <h4> Stop/Clear button </h4>
    <img src="./project-photos/stop_clear.jpg" width="200">
    <p>
      The stop/clear button on my microwave has a small closed and open lock saying
      "hold"
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no idea what it does and I have tried to hold the button down to see
      if it locks my microwavave's door.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="power_level" class="problem">
    <h3> Power level </h3>
    <p>
      One of the <b>Rare uses</b> that I can think of is selecting the power level
      for the cooking. Once in a lifetime I will try a recepie which will tell me
      to select the power level. I have tried it in the past and I was not able to
      figure it out how to set the power level.<i>Microwave telling me how to
      use this option </i>This control unit has only one mechanism of telling me
      that it is the wrong option, which is beeping twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      while working this report I was able to figure out how to select power level.
       Even though I was able to figure it out after few tries(while hurting my fingers)
       I was still confused on what the numbers meant. <i>Common mistake</i>
       I was confused on when to select the power level, before clicking start or
       after start as I was able to change power level to some unknown level.
       See the below gif.

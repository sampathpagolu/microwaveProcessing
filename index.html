      <p><b>Common usage</b>: Buttons are the most used feature on a Microwave.

        My microwave has 25 buttons in total. Each and every button when pressed
        plays a beep as sound <i><u>feedback</i></u> to the user. More options equals more
        complexity. Keeping that aside, the major flaw in my Microwave's design
        is Buttons, which are very hard to press.

        My microwave always displays the wrong time, I could change it to show
        correct the time and I have tried, gave up halfway because my finger
        started to hurt.

        <p><b>Common sequence</b>: I am hungry and I want to cook some rice for
          myself. I have to cook the rice in Microwave oven for approximately 20 minutes.
          This time varies according to the quantity of rice I am cooking. For suppose
          one day I am cooking extra rice, I have to put in more time. If I make a
          mistake in entering the time I have to start again. If I put less time,
          I can add more time by clicking on "add 30 sec" button. What if I want to
          add 5 minutes, I have to click 10 times to add 5 minutes.</p>

        <p><b>Solution</b>:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Replace the buttons with something more tactile. Buttons which are
              clickable are more comfortable, they also provide a haptic <i><u>feedback</i></u>
              that can be super helpful.</li>
            <li>Remove the buttons entirely for setting and time introduce a dial for
              easy setting of the time.</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Display</h3>
      <p>
        My Microwave has a tiny display, that is good enough to set the time,
        see the remaining time or check the time of the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Common sequence/Common mistake</b>: I am very stressed due to a project submission
        and I want to drink some tea. I go to the kitchen to heat the water for my
        tea I pour water into cup and put it in the Microwave oven and start cooking
        by pressing down onone of the express cook options. It beeps twice, giving
        me <i><u>feedback</i></u> that timer is already set for something else.
      </p>

      <img id="pro_img" src="./project-photos/display.jpg" width="200" id="display1">
      <img id="pro_img" src="./project-photos/display.gif" width="350" id="display2">

      <p>
        First image is when timer is set. Second Image is Time of the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I check the display, I see in very tiny letters saying cook. Now I
        have to click start/stop button or reset it and give a new time. This
        seemingly small clicks to heat my water is very annoying. Even though
        there is some indication that time of the day is being displayed with, ':'
        is blinking which is hardly noticeable at a single glance.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Solution</b>: Add different colored LEDs to give the user <i><u>feedback</i></u>
        on what is being displayed at the moment. A red LED can be used to display
        the timer like in the image below. Now a days LEDs can show multiple colors
        according to the voltage fed to them. If those LEDs are used, different
        colors can be displayed.
      </p>

      <img id="pro_img" src="./project-photos/timer.PNG" width="200" id="timer">

      <p>
        Alternatively, a new feature can be added to the microwave. If cooking
        stops in the middle, the timer should reset after a certain period of time.
        There is no use in preserving the remaining cooking time hours after the
        timer is stopped in the middle.

      <h3> Stop/Clear button </h3>
      <img id="pro_img" src="./project-photos/stop_clear.jpg" width="200" id="stop_clear">
      <p>
        The stop/clear button on my microwave has a small closed and open lock saying
        "hold"
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no idea what it does and I have tried to hold the button down to see
        if it locks my microwavave's door.

    </div>
    <div id="power_level" class="problem">
      <h3> Power level </h3>
      <p>
        One of the <b>Rare uses</b> that I can think of is selecting the power level
        for the cooking. Once in a lifetime I will try a recepie which will tell me
        to select the power level. I have tried it in the past and I was not able to
        figure it out how to set the power level.<i><u>Microwave telling me how to
            use this option </i></u>This control unit has only one mechanism of telling me
        that it is the wrong option, which is beeping twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        while working this report I was able to figure out how to select power level.
        Even though I was able to figure it out after few tries(while hurting my fingers)
        I was still confused on what the numbers meant. <i><u>Common mistake</i></u>:
        I was confused on when to select the power level, before clicking start or
        after start as I was able to change power level to some unknown level.
        See the below gif.

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <img id="pro_img" src="./project-photos/screens.png" width="800" id="screens">
      <p>
        For my design, I will be having 3 screens. I will be explaining how I will be overcoming
        the desgin flaws explained above using the three screens that I will be implementing
        using processing.
      </p>
      <h4>First screen</h4>
      <p>
          In the first screen, My new microwave will have a seven segment display,
          to show the time. Below that, today's date. Lastly, start button.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first design flaw being the button being very hard to press. With the
        use of touchscreen, my main flaw automatically is solved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next minor flaw with the buttons is that there are too many. In total I will be having 5
        buttons across all of the microwave options.
      </p>
      <h4> Second screen</h4>
      <p>
        In the second screen the microwave oven lets the user to input time and
        select power level.
      </p>
      <p>
          Now for inputting the time, I have used controlP5 knob. I have preset time
          values for, 30 secs, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes,
          60 minutes and 90 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Power level is controlP5 slider with three values: 800, 1000, 1200. Default is
        800 Watts.
      </p>
      <p>
        User after selecting the time and power level, if they click the "Go" button,
        they will be taken to the final screen.
      </p>
      <h4>Third screen</h4>
      <p>
        In the third screen the user will now see the countdown timer and an option to clear.
        If the user hits clear he will be taken to the first screen.
      </p>
    </div>
